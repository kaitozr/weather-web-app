# weather-web-app 🌥️ 
Begginer project with little to no good practices.

When i started, the idea was to made it show the preview for the next days but when i get to the API i learned that its better to check the API capability first 🙃 (it was a paid feature).

The page shows the date, temperature and changes the icon for the weather.
